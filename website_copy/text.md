landing page, create a well structured table like landing page 
which shows all the data in a tabular format, create a table.ts file
and fetch the data from there


data will contain the benchmark data which is proving time, verification time 
of differnet circuits (keccak, sha, etc) and frameworks (mopro, etc) in seconds
in various mobile platforms

and the navbar which look in the homepage, will only contain deimos on left side
clicking which will redirect to landing page and Home (linked to landing page), Docs and about on other side


after clicking docs, we will get redirected to /documentation page, which is the current
/documentation page

it will also include a side bar like in sidebar.png which would be a 2 level tree 
like structure. from there we can navigate to different section of docs namely
getStarted, circuits, mopro and contributing.

also paths for them will be like /docs/getstarted instead of the current /getstarted
you will have to update the current file structure to make this possible
